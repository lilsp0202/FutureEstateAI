# FutureEstateAI üè†

With FutureEstateAI, one can get an idea of how valuable a certain real estate property is in the future. Having an idea of the future prices of a certain property can provide valuable information and confirmation for one to make a decision to invest in the propery. 

This project was done as part of my summer internship with Dhiomics Analytics. 

## Architectural Overview

**Languages and Libraries used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

For the purpose of this application, I implemted a linear regression model. In addition to the development and training of the model, I also conducted a great amount of data analysis and data preprocessing, so as to make the data better fit the model. 

As part of the project, I also created a detailed pdf that consists of the data analysis and preprocessing done, which is present in this repository.
